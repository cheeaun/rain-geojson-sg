# Rain GeoJSON SG

> Straight-forward API server to convert rain area radar images (Singapore) to GeoJSON.

![Convert rain area radar image to GeoJSON](radar2geojson.png)

- 50-km radar images: [Weather.gov.sg](http://www.weather.gov.sg/weather-rain-area-50km/)
- 70-km radar images: [MyENV apps](http://www.nea.gov.sg/)
- Radar images are generated every 5 minutes.
- Raster image is converted to GeoJSON, pixel by pixel. From pixels to polygons.
- Polygons in GeoJSON are grouped by color/intensity into `MultiPolygon`s. Adjacent polygons are unioned/combined.
- Intensity values are improvised to be 0-100. These may not be standard/scientific values. They are reverse-engineered from the rain intensity color scheme (Light â†’ Moderate â†’ Heavy).
- Only the latest GeoJSON data is cached and will updated every few minutes.

# ðŸš§ UPDATE: GeoJSON output is not used anymore ðŸš§

---

ðŸš§ Current root (`/`) API calls runs on `micro` which is not very "serverless". This endpoint will be deprecated soon.

ðŸš§ A new set of APIs have been added as `/api` endpoints which runs better as serverless functions.

## Technicalities

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/download) is required to run this server. These are the commands:

- `npm i` - install all dependencies
  <strike>
- `npm run dev` - run a development server
- `npm start` - run a production server
  </strike>
- `vercel dev` - runs local server

The URLs:

<strike>

- `/` - return a basic JSON of basic information
- `/now` - return the GeoJSON result of latest radar image

</strike>

- `/api/observations` - returns weather observations data (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, etc)
- `/api/rainarea` - returns precipitation radar data.
